# TurtleBot Photogrammetry Toolkit

This repository contains a portable toolchain for collecting TurtleBot 4 image datasets with known camera poses for photogrammetry, Structure-from-Motion, COLMAP, and 3D Gaussian Splatting workflows. It supports both Gazebo simulation captures from repeatable GUI-camera viewpoints and physical TurtleBot OAK-D captures where image poses are looked up from ROS TF.

The repo provides:

- launch scripts for starting TurtleBot 4 Gazebo worlds with localization, Nav2, SLAM, and optional custom GUI-camera controls
- a ROS/Gazebo overlay containing the WASD camera plugin and bundled TurtleBot 4 world/model assets
- Gazebo GUI-camera waypoint recording and screenshot replay tools that write PNG images, `poses.csv`, and `transforms.json`
- physical TurtleBot OAK-D capture tools that save images with TF-based optical camera poses and camera calibration metadata
- photogrammetry path generation, editing, visualization, and Nav2-driven capture utilities
- COLMAP/3DGS export scripts for turning captured image runs into reconstruction-ready datasets
- config files and examples for keeping local paths, maps, worlds, and GUI settings out of the scripts

The bundled defaults target the included small-house world, but the scripts are intentionally parameterized so other Gazebo worlds, model folders, Nav2 maps, physical robot namespaces, and capture topics can be used by changing config values or passing command-line options.

Generated `tb4_overlay_ws/build`, `tb4_overlay_ws/install`, and `tb4_overlay_ws/log` directories are intentionally ignored by git.

## Requirements

- ROS 2 Jazzy installed at `/opt/ros/jazzy`
- Gazebo Harmonic / `gz` CLI
- TurtleBot 4 simulator dependencies installed on the machine
- `colcon` and normal ROS build tooling
- Python 3 with `numpy` for `capture_gui_camera_survey.py`

## Configure

The scripts read configuration from `config/project.env` by default. For a clean clone:

```bash
cp config/project.env.example config/project.env
```

All relative paths in the config are resolved from the repository root. You can also use a different config file:

```bash
CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/project.env bash scripts/run_wasd_world.sh
```

## Build

Build the overlay before launching:

```bash
bash scripts/build_overlay.sh
```

This creates `tb4_overlay_ws/install/setup.bash` and compiles the custom WASD Gazebo GUI plugin. Re-run this command after changing plugin source files.

## Launch Defaults

Launch the default TurtleBot simulation with RViz, localization, and Nav2:

```bash
bash scripts/run_turtlebot_world.sh
```

Launch the default world with WASD Gazebo GUI camera controls:

```bash
bash scripts/run_wasd_world.sh
```

## Record Camera Poses

This workflow records poses from the Gazebo GUI camera, not the TurtleBot robot camera. Use it when you want to manually fly through a world with WASD controls and save viewpoints for later screenshot capture.

1. Start Gazebo with the WASD camera plugin in one terminal:

```bash
bash scripts/run_wasd_world.sh --world small_house
```

For another world, pass its name or SDF path:

```bash
bash scripts/run_wasd_world.sh --world warehouse
bash scripts/run_wasd_world.sh --world path/to/custom_world.sdf
```

2. In a second terminal, start the pose recorder and choose the output JSON path explicitly:

```bash
python3 scripts/record_gui_camera_waypoints.py \
  --output data/my_world/waypoints.json
```

3. Keep Gazebo focused and move the GUI camera using the WASD panel controls.

4. Press `C` while Gazebo is focused to save the current camera pose.

5. Press `=` while Gazebo is focused to finish. The script writes a JSON list of saved GUI camera poses to the `--output` path.

If global X11 hotkeys are not available, use terminal mode instead:

```bash
python3 scripts/record_gui_camera_waypoints.py \
  --output data/my_world/waypoints.json \
  --terminal
```

In terminal mode, press `Enter` in the recorder terminal to save a pose, and type `q` then `Enter` to finish.

## Capture Screenshots From Recorded Poses

This workflow replays a waypoint JSON file, moves the Gazebo GUI camera to each saved pose exactly as recorded, captures screenshots, and writes pose metadata.

1. Start Gazebo with the same world used for recording through the WASD launch script:

```bash
bash scripts/run_wasd_world.sh --world small_house
```

The replay script depends on the GUI camera behavior exposed by this WASD launch/config path. Launching the normal TurtleBot simulation with `run_turtlebot_world.sh` can still show the world, but camera movement during screenshot replay may not work reliably there.

2. In a second terminal, replay the recorded poses and choose every output path explicitly:

```bash
python3 scripts/capture_gui_camera_survey.py \
  --waypoints data/my_world/waypoints.json \
  --images-dir data/my_world/screenshots/images \
  --poses-csv data/my_world/screenshots/poses.csv \
  --transforms-json data/my_world/screenshots/transforms.json
```

The outputs are:

```text
data/my_world/screenshots/images/       PNG screenshots
data/my_world/screenshots/poses.csv     pose metadata table
data/my_world/screenshots/transforms.json
```

Before each screenshot, the script asks Gazebo to move the GUI camera and waits until `/gui/camera/pose` reports the requested pose. If your machine is slow, increase the wait or settle times:

```bash
python3 scripts/capture_gui_camera_survey.py \
  --waypoints data/my_world/waypoints.json \
  --images-dir data/my_world/screenshots/images \
  --poses-csv data/my_world/screenshots/poses.csv \
  --transforms-json data/my_world/screenshots/transforms.json \
  --move-timeout-sec 6.0 \
  --settle-sec 1.0
```

If Gazebo writes screenshots somewhere unexpected, pass one or more explicit search directories:

```bash
python3 scripts/capture_gui_camera_survey.py \
  --waypoints data/my_world/waypoints.json \
  --images-dir data/my_world/screenshots/images \
  --poses-csv data/my_world/screenshots/poses.csv \
  --transforms-json data/my_world/screenshots/transforms.json \
  --screenshot-search-dir /tmp \
  --screenshot-search-dir /path/to/gazebo/screenshots
```

## Export Known Poses For COLMAP

After screenshot capture, export the run as a COLMAP text model with known camera poses:

```bash
python3 scripts/export_colmap_known_poses.py \
  --poses-csv data/my_world/screenshots/poses.csv \
  --images-dir data/my_world/screenshots/images \
  --output-dir data/my_world/colmap_known
```

This writes:

```text
data/my_world/colmap_known/cameras.txt
data/my_world/colmap_known/images.txt
data/my_world/colmap_known/points3D.txt
```

The exporter converts the Gazebo GUI camera pose convention into COLMAP's world-to-camera optical convention. By default it writes one shared `SIMPLE_PINHOLE` camera and derives focal length from a 90 degree horizontal field of view. Override intrinsics if you know them:

```bash
python3 scripts/export_colmap_known_poses.py \
  --poses-csv data/my_world/screenshots/poses.csv \
  --images-dir data/my_world/screenshots/images \
  --output-dir data/my_world/colmap_known \
  --focal-px 917.5 \
  --cx 917.5 \
  --cy 481.5
```

If you already created a COLMAP database and need image IDs to match it, pass the database path:

```bash
python3 scripts/export_colmap_known_poses.py \
  --poses-csv data/my_world/screenshots/poses.csv \
  --images-dir data/my_world/screenshots/images \
  --output-dir data/my_world/colmap_known \
  --database-path path/to/database.db
```

## COLMAP Pipeline For 3DGS

The goal of this pipeline is to produce a COLMAP-style dataset that can be passed to 3D Gaussian Splatting implementations. The images come from Gazebo, the camera poses come from `poses.csv`, and COLMAP is used only to compute feature matches and triangulate a sparse point cloud from those known poses.

For the full default pipeline, use the wrapper script:

```bash
bash scripts/run_colmap_3dgs_pipeline.sh \
  --run-dir data/my_world \
  --overwrite
```

This runs feature extraction, sequential matching, known-pose export, triangulation, binary conversion, and PLY export. It creates a flat Brush/3DGS-style output folder at:

```text
data/my_world/brush_output/
```

That folder contains all captured images plus:

```text
cameras.bin
images.bin
points3D.bin
points3D.ply
```

By default, the wrapper derives intrinsics from the first image and the configured 90 degree Gazebo GUI horizontal FOV. Override them if needed:

```bash
bash scripts/run_colmap_3dgs_pipeline.sh \
  --run-dir data/my_world \
  --focal-px 917.5 \
  --cx 917.5 \
  --cy 481.5 \
  --overwrite
```

The manual commands below are the same pipeline broken down step by step.

Set paths for one run:

```bash
cd /path/to/TurtleBot-Photogrammetry-Toolkit

RUN=data/my_world
IMG=$RUN/screenshots/images
COLMAP_OUT=$RUN/colmap

mkdir -p "$COLMAP_OUT"
```

1. Create the COLMAP database and extract image features.

This detects SIFT features in each screenshot and stores the image records, camera model, and feature descriptors in `database.db`. The camera parameters must match the known-pose export. The values below are the defaults for 1835 x 963 screenshots with a 90 degree horizontal FOV.

```bash
colmap feature_extractor \
  --database_path "$COLMAP_OUT/database.db" \
  --image_path "$IMG" \
  --ImageReader.camera_model SIMPLE_PINHOLE \
  --ImageReader.single_camera 1 \
  --ImageReader.camera_params "917.5,917.5,481.5"
```

2. Match image features.

This finds 2D correspondences between images. For ordered camera paths, `sequential_matcher` is usually faster than exhaustive matching and works well when neighboring screenshots overlap.

```bash
colmap sequential_matcher \
  --database_path "$COLMAP_OUT/database.db" \
  --SequentialMatching.overlap 10
```

Increase `--SequentialMatching.overlap` if the sparse cloud is too thin. For small unordered datasets, `exhaustive_matcher` is a simpler but slower alternative.

3. Export the known camera poses in COLMAP text format.

This writes `cameras.txt`, `images.txt`, and an empty `points3D.txt`. The `--database-path` argument makes the image IDs match the COLMAP database, which is required by `point_triangulator`.

```bash
python3 scripts/export_colmap_known_poses.py \
  --poses-csv "$RUN/screenshots/poses.csv" \
  --images-dir "$IMG" \
  --output-dir "$COLMAP_OUT/sparse_known" \
  --database-path "$COLMAP_OUT/database.db" \
  --focal-px 917.5 \
  --cx 917.5 \
  --cy 481.5
```

4. Triangulate sparse 3D points from the known poses.

This uses the fixed camera poses plus the feature matches to create a sparse COLMAP reconstruction. It does not estimate a new camera trajectory.

```bash
mkdir -p "$COLMAP_OUT/sparse/0"

colmap point_triangulator \
  --database_path "$COLMAP_OUT/database.db" \
  --image_path "$IMG" \
  --input_path "$COLMAP_OUT/sparse_known" \
  --output_path "$COLMAP_OUT/sparse/0"
```

5. Convert the sparse model to binary COLMAP files.

`point_triangulator` may write a text or binary model depending on COLMAP version/settings. This command ensures the intermediate model contains `cameras.bin`, `images.bin`, and `points3D.bin`.

```bash
colmap model_converter \
  --input_path "$COLMAP_OUT/sparse/0" \
  --output_path "$COLMAP_OUT/sparse/0" \
  --output_type BIN
```

6. Create the flat Brush/3DGS output folder.

Brush expects the images and COLMAP `.bin` files on the same directory level, not nested under `sparse/0`.

```bash
BRUSH_OUT="$RUN/brush_output"
mkdir -p "$BRUSH_OUT"

cp -a "$IMG"/* "$BRUSH_OUT"/
cp -a "$COLMAP_OUT/sparse/0/cameras.bin" "$BRUSH_OUT"/
cp -a "$COLMAP_OUT/sparse/0/images.bin" "$BRUSH_OUT"/
cp -a "$COLMAP_OUT/sparse/0/points3D.bin" "$BRUSH_OUT"/
```

The resulting Brush/3DGS folder is:

```text
data/my_world/brush_output/
  00000.png
  00001.png
  ...
  cameras.bin
  images.bin
  points3D.bin
```

Optionally export a PLY point cloud for inspection:

```bash
colmap model_converter \
  --input_path "$COLMAP_OUT/sparse/0" \
  --output_path "$BRUSH_OUT/points3D.ply" \
  --output_type PLY
```

## Physical TurtleBot OAK-D Capture

For a physical TurtleBot 4, the recorder captures the robot's OAK-D RGB stream and looks up the camera pose from TF at the image timestamp. It writes the same kind of run folder as the Gazebo workflow, but the pose convention is different: poses are `oakd_rgb_camera_optical_frame` in a ROS target frame such as `map` or `odom`.

Run it on the robot or on a machine that can receive the robot's ROS topics:

```bash
python3 scripts/capture_physical_turtlebot_survey.py \
  --image-topic /robot_1/oakd/rgb/image_raw \
  --camera-info-topic /robot_1/oakd/rgb/camera_info \
  --target-frame map \
  --camera-frame oakd_rgb_camera_optical_frame \
  --images-dir data/robot_1_run/screenshots/images \
  --poses-csv data/robot_1_run/screenshots/poses.csv \
  --transforms-json data/robot_1_run/screenshots/transforms.json \
  --camera-info-json data/robot_1_run/screenshots/camera_info.json \
  --tf-lookup-offset-sec 0.05 \
  --ros-args -r /tf:=/robot_1/tf -r /tf_static:=/robot_1/tf_static
```

Type `c` then `Enter` to capture a frame. Type `q` then `Enter` to finish. If AMCL is not active, use `--target-frame odom` instead of `map`. The small `--tf-lookup-offset-sec` compensates for camera timestamps that can run a few milliseconds ahead of the latest TF sample.

Generated photogrammetry waypoint CSV files can be edited on top of the PGM map before driving the robot:

```bash
python3 scripts/edit_photogrammetry_path_gui.py \
  --map-yaml /home/student/texttoturtle/DLML_TextToTurtleBot/cps_labor_map.yaml \
  --path-csv data/path_plans/cps_labor_lawnmower_y_component.csv \
  --output-csv data/path_plans/cps_labor_lawnmower_y_component_edited.csv
```

Drag points to move them, select a point and press `Delete` to remove it, enable `Add on click` to insert points, and use `Yaw +/-15` to adjust heading.

The same GUI can also create a new region-limited lawnmower path from an empty map:

```bash
python3 scripts/edit_photogrammetry_path_gui.py \
  --map-yaml /home/student/texttoturtle/DLML_TextToTurtleBot/cps_labor_map.yaml \
  --output-csv data/path_plans/cps_labor_region_lawnmower.csv
```

Click `Select Region`, drag a rectangle inside the room, click `Set Start`, click the start point inside that rectangle, choose grid and clearance values, then click `Generate In Region`.

Export the physical capture to a COLMAP text model:

```bash
python3 scripts/export_colmap_physical_poses.py \
  --poses-csv data/robot_1_run/screenshots/poses.csv \
  --images-dir data/robot_1_run/screenshots/images \
  --camera-info-json data/robot_1_run/screenshots/camera_info.json \
  --output-dir data/robot_1_run/colmap_known \
  --camera-model PINHOLE
```

The physical exporter assumes the saved pose is already a ROS optical camera pose. ROS optical camera coordinates match COLMAP camera coordinates: x right, y down, z forward. For distorted raw OAK-D images, either rectify images before export and use `PINHOLE`, or export with a distortion-capable COLMAP model such as `OPENCV` or `FULL_OPENCV`.

To let Nav2 drive a generated path and capture automatically at each waypoint:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_nav2_photogrammetry_capture.py \
  --waypoints-csv data/path_plans/cps_labor_region_lawnmower.csv \
  --navigate-action /robot_2/navigate_to_pose \
  --image-topic /robot_2/oakd/rgb/image_raw \
  --camera-info-topic /robot_2/oakd/rgb/camera_info \
  --target-frame map \
  --camera-frame oakd_rgb_camera_optical_frame \
  --images-dir data/robot_2_auto_run/screenshots/images \
  --poses-csv data/robot_2_auto_run/screenshots/poses.csv \
  --transforms-json data/robot_2_auto_run/screenshots/transforms.json \
  --camera-info-json data/robot_2_auto_run/screenshots/camera_info.json \
  --progress-json data/robot_2_auto_run/progress.json \
  --settle-sec 1.0 \
  --nav-retries 3 \
  --tf-lookup-offset-sec 0.02 \
  --ros-args -r /tf:=/robot_2/tf -r /tf_static:=/robot_2/tf_static
```

The runner writes progress after every waypoint and resumes from `progress.json` by default. If Nav2 fails repeatedly, the script asks whether to retry the same waypoint, skip it, or stop.

## Use Another Gazebo World

Worlds can be launched by name if the SDF exists under:

```text
tb4_overlay_ws/src/turtlebot4_gz_bringup/worlds/
```

Example:

```bash
bash scripts/run_wasd_world.sh --world warehouse
bash scripts/run_turtlebot_world.sh --world warehouse --localization false --nav2 false
```

You can also pass an SDF path. Relative paths are resolved from the repository root:

```bash
bash scripts/run_wasd_world.sh --world worlds/my_world.sdf
bash scripts/run_wasd_world.sh --world /absolute/path/to/my_world.sdf
```

For TurtleBot launch, `--world` is passed to `turtlebot4_gz.launch.py` as a world name, so place the world SDF in the overlay world's directory and pass the name without `.sdf`.

## Add A New World

1. Add the SDF file:

```text
tb4_overlay_ws/src/turtlebot4_gz_bringup/worlds/my_world.sdf
```

2. Add any custom models under:

```text
tb4_overlay_ws/src/turtlebot4_gz_bringup/models/
```

3. Make sure model URIs use `model://model_name/...` and that the model directory contains `model.config` and `model.sdf`.

4. Rebuild the overlay if launch/package files changed:

```bash
bash scripts/build_overlay.sh
```

5. Launch with WASD camera controls:

```bash
bash scripts/run_wasd_world.sh --world my_world
```

6. Launch with TurtleBot, if the world is compatible with TurtleBot spawning:

```bash
bash scripts/run_turtlebot_world.sh --world my_world --localization false --nav2 false
```

If you do not have a map for the new world yet, keep localization and Nav2 disabled.

## Use Another Nav2 Map

A Nav2 map normally has at least:

```text
assets/maps/my_world/map.yaml
assets/maps/my_world/map.pgm
```

The YAML should reference the image file, usually with a relative path:

```yaml
image: map.pgm
resolution: 0.05
origin: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
negate: 0
occupied_thresh: 0.65
free_thresh: 0.25
```

Launch TurtleBot with that map:

```bash
bash scripts/run_turtlebot_world.sh \
  --world my_world \
  --map assets/maps/my_world/map.yaml \
  --localization true \
  --nav2 true
```

Set the initial robot pose to match the map/world coordinate frame:

```bash
bash scripts/run_turtlebot_world.sh \
  --world my_world \
  --map assets/maps/my_world/map.yaml \
  --x 0.0 --y 0.0 --z 0.35 --yaw 0.0
```

## Create A Map For A New World

Typical workflow:

1. Launch the world without localization/Nav2:

```bash
bash scripts/run_turtlebot_world.sh --world my_world --localization false --nav2 false
```

2. Run SLAM using your preferred TurtleBot/Nav2 SLAM workflow.

3. Drive the robot through the environment.

4. Save the map as `map.yaml` and `map.pgm` under `assets/maps/my_world/`.

5. Relaunch with `--map assets/maps/my_world/map.yaml --localization true --nav2 true`.

## Config Defaults

The default config lives at:

```text
config/project.env
```

Useful values:

```bash
WORLD=tb4_overlay_ws/src/turtlebot4_gz_bringup/worlds/small_house.sdf
GUI_CONFIG=tb4_overlay_ws/src/turtlebot4_gz_bringup/gui/wasd_camera/gui.config
MAP_YAML=assets/maps/turtlebot3_waffle_pi/map.yaml
MODEL_PATH=tb4_overlay_ws/src/turtlebot4_gz_bringup/models
```

Use command-line arguments for one-off launches and edit `config/project.env` for local defaults.
